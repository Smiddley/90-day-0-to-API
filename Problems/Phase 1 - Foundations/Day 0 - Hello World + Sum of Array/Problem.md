Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the sum of all numbers.

Example:

`Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 15

Input: []
Output: 0`


Constraints:

Array length: 0 ≤ n ≤ 1000

Integers can be positive, negative, or zero


## Learning Goals

- Practice function definition
- Practice loops / iteration
- Learn returning values
- Set up Go and Python side-by-side solution
- Test workflow (run tests, commit, PR)

## Cloud / Networking Analogy:
Think of the array as packets flowing through a network device. Your function is like a counter in the control plane that aggregates values (packets) for reporting.
