# Day 21 - Valid Anagram

Problem Statement

Given two strings s and t, determine whether t is an anagram of s.

Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters with the same frequencies, but possibly in a different order.

Return true if t is an anagram of s, otherwise return false.

Input

s: a string

t: a string

Strings consist of lowercase English letters

Output

Boolean value indicating whether the strings are anagrams

Example
Input:  s = "anagram", t = "nagaram"
Output: true

What This Problem Is Testing

Frequency counting

Hash map usage

Linear-time string comparison

Cloud Analogy

Verifying two configuration files define the same rules, regardless of ordering.
