Problem Statement

Write an algorithm to determine whether a number n is a happy number.

A happy number is defined by the following process:

Repeat the process until the number equals 1, or it loops endlessly

Return true if the number is happy, otherwise return false.

Input

n: a positive integer

Output

Boolean value indicating whether the number is happy

Example
Input:  19
Output: true
