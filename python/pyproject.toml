# What it is:
#The modern, canonical configuration file for Python projects.
# What it replaces (over time):
# setup.py
# Tool-specific config files (setup.cfg, .flake8, etc.)
# Why you want it even early:
# Central place for tool configuration (formatter, linter, test runner)
# Future-proof (PEP 517 / 518)
# Required if you ever package or publish anything

# Analogy (Cloud):
# This is your service manifest — like a Helm chart or Terraform module metadata.
# Even if it’s mostly empty at first, it establishes structure and intent.
